  * `client-constructor-var` - this is the var of that is assigned the value of

  * `options-fn` - a functin which creates the client client options, including
    basic defaults, for the implementation; it should be a function that in
    turn calls a `CMR*ClientOpions` constructor
  * `http-client-constructor` - a function that instrantiates the CMR HTTP
